# jlox

A small interpreted programming language from the book "Crafting Interpreters".

## IMPORTANT

I don't really care about this implementation cause it's:

1. In Java (ðŸ¤¢)
2. Uses AST's and inheritance for runtime representation of objects

I'm more interested in C implementation of the lox language, so don't take this repo seriously. Thanks :>

UPD(02.02.24): Apparently the C implementation (at least the one in the book) is still pretty bad and stubborn,
so i won't continue it's development. Instead I'll probably focus on my own (?) language, which will be implemented in C++.

## Usage

```bash
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/<jar file>
```

## TODOs

- [x] complete the project
